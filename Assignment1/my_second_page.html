        <h4><strong>Milton Glaser</strong></h4>
        <blockquote>“There are three responses to a piece of design – yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for."
        </blockquote>
        <h4><strong>Massimo Vignelli</strong></h4>
        <blockquote>"The life of a designer is a life of fight. Fight against the ugliness. Just like a doctor fights
            against
            disease. For us, the visual disease is what we have around, and what we try to do is cure it somehow
            with design."</blockquote>
        <h4><strong>Paul Cookson</strong></h4>
        <blockquote>"great web design without functionality is like a sports car with no engine.”</blockquote>
        <h4><strong>Cameron Moll</strong></h4>
        <blockquote>"What separates design from art is that design is meant to be... functional.”</blockquote>
